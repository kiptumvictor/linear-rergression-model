# ROAD ACCIDENT SEVERITY PREDICTION MODEL.
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts road accident severity using various factors such as age, gender, driving experience, and type of vehicle. The model is built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and other essential data preprocessing tools.
## Project Overview
Road accidents are a critical issue, and predicting the severity of accidents can help in resource allocation and improving safety measures. This project aims to predict accident severity based on a dataset of historical road accident data.
### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and categorical feature encoding.
- **Modeling**: Uses Linear Regression for predicting accident severity.
- **Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Prediction**:it is used to test the model made.
  ## Dataset
  They include:
  - `Age_band_of_driver`
- `Sex_of_driver`
- `Educational_level`
- `Driving_experience`
- `Type_of_vehicle`
- `Accident_severity` (Target Variable)
